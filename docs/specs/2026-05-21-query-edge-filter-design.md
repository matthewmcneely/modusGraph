# Edge-Predicate Filtering for Generated Query Builders

## Goal

Let a generated `<Entity>Query` filter root records by a scalar predicate of a
*neighbouring* node reached over an edge — "people who have a dog named Fido" —
as a first-class, generated method:

```go
client.Person.Query(ctx).WhereDogs(`eq(name, "Fido")`).Nodes()
```

Today `<Entity>Query.Filter` (and the `typed.Query[T].Filter` it delegates to)
only constrains the root node's *own* predicates: the filter string lands in
dgraph's root `@filter`, which has no syntax for an edge target's scalar value.
There is no way, short of hand-written DQL through `Client.QueryRaw`, to express
"root has an edge whose target matches X."

## Non-Goals

- **A typed predicate DSL.** `WhereDogs(filter string, params ...any)` takes a
  dgraph `@filter` string, exactly like the existing `Filter`. A type-safe
  `WhereDogs(func(c *DogCriteria){ c.NameEq("Fido") })` face is future work; it
  would layer over the same `WhereEdge` substrate this spec introduces.
- **Multi-hop filters** (root → edge → edge). The filter string constrains the
  *immediate* edge target's own predicates.
- **Changing `Filter`, `Nodes`, `First`, `IterNodes`, or CRUD.**

## Why This Approach

**dgman emits one query block.** A `typed.Query[T]` wraps a single
`*dg.Query`, which dgman renders as one root `@filter` over an `expand`
body (`query.go:generateQuery`). dgman exposes no way to attach a `@filter` to
an edge sub-block. So edge filtering cannot be a new dgman builder call — it
needs a genuinely separate execution path.

**Server-side semi-join in one request.** A query carrying edge constraints
runs as a single multi-block DQL request:

1. **Var block** — `<var> as var(func: <root>) @cascade { … one filtered block
   per edge constraint }`. `@cascade` drops any node with an empty block, so the
   `as` variable binds exactly the roots that satisfy every constraint. The
   variable lives on the server.
2. **Data block** — the existing `*dg.Query`, intersected with `uid(<var>)`,
   carrying the caller's `Filter`, ordering, pagination, and dgman's normal
   projection.
3. **Count block** (only for `NodesAndCount`) — `count(uid)` over `uid(<var>)`
   with the caller's `Filter` re-applied, so the total matches the rows the data
   block would return without pagination.

The matched UIDs are never returned to the client or inlined into a
`uid(0x1, 0x2, …)` literal. Memory and DQL size stay bounded by the query, not
by how many roots match. This is the same shape dgman's own `NodesAndCount`
uses internally (`filtered as var(...)` feeding `func: uid(filtered)`).

**On the rejected alternative.** An earlier draft of this design ran the
semi-join client-side — a pre-pass returned the matching UIDs, which the main
query then inlined as `uid(<matched>)` — and rejected a `QueryRaw` two-block
query on the grounds that it would force re-implementing the result projection
(`expand` drops managed reverse edges, `reverse_test.go`). That reasoning
assumed the data block's body would be *hand-written*. It need not be: rendering
the request with `dg.NewQueryBlock(varBlock, dataBlock).String()` lets dgman
generate the data block's projection exactly as it does for a normal query, so
reverse-edge-aware expansion is preserved. The request is then executed with
`Client.QueryRaw`, and the data block is decoded through the typed
predicate-remap path (see `multi_query.go`). This is strictly better than the
client-side pre-pass: the UIDs stay on the server (bounded memory and DQL size),
and for the single-shot terminals (`Nodes`, `First`, `NodesAndCount`) the whole
semi-join runs in one read-only transaction, closing the second-read
consistency window the client-side form had.

**`IterNodes`.** Each page is its own request that re-resolves the var block
server-side and pages the data block with `first`/`offset`. Memory stays bounded
regardless of result size — the property the streaming terminal advertises — at
the cost of re-running the `@cascade` match per page, and of reading each page
from a fresh snapshot rather than one transaction. For the unbounded-result case
this terminal exists to serve, bounded memory is the property that matters.

## Design

### `typed.Query[T]` — the `WhereEdge` substrate

`Query[T]` carries `conn`/`ctx` (to run the request) and an `edges` slice;
`customRootExpr` records a caller's `UID`/`RootFunc` narrowing so the var block
can root at it:

```go
type Query[T any] struct {
	q              *dg.Query
	conn           modusgraph.Client
	ctx            context.Context
	limit          int
	offset         int
	edges          []edgeFilter
	filters        []filterFrag
	customRootExpr string
}

type edgeFilter struct {
	predicate string
	filter    string
	params    []any
}
```

New builder, accumulating (each call ANDs another constraint):

```go
func (qb *Query[T]) WhereEdge(predicate, filter string, params ...any) *Query[T]
```

The terminals (`Nodes`, `First`, `IterNodes`, `NodesAndCount`) check for edge
constraints. With none, they run the plain dgman query unchanged. With
constraints, they call `runEdge`, which assembles the var/data/(count) blocks,
renders them with `dg.NewQueryBlock`, runs the request via `QueryRaw`, and
decodes. `runEdge` pushes the data-block filter onto `qb.q` last-write-wins and
never mutates the accumulated filters, so `IterNodes` can call it once per page.

### Server-side var DQL

For `WhereEdge("pets", `eq(name, $1)`, "Fido")` over `Owner`, with a root
`Filter(`eq(name, "Alice")`)` and `NodesAndCount`:

```dql
{
  mgMatched as var(func: type(Owner)) @filter(has(dgraph.type)) @cascade {
    uid
    mg_e0 : pets @filter(eq(name, "Fido")) { uid }
  }
  mgData(func: type(Owner)) @filter(has(dgraph.type) AND (eq(name, "Alice")) AND uid(mgMatched)) {
    uid
    expand(_all_) { … }
  }
  mgCount(func: uid(mgMatched)) @filter(has(dgraph.type) AND (eq(name, "Alice"))) {
    count(uid)
  }
}
```

The var block is built by reconfiguring a fresh `conn.Query(ctx, &T{})` with
`As(mgMatched).Var().Cascade().Query(body, params...)`; when the caller narrowed
the root, the var block roots at `customRootExpr` so the match is the
intersection of the caller's root and the edge constraints, not an overwrite.
Every edge block is aliased `mg_e0`, `mg_e1`, … so two constraints on the same
predicate do not collide as duplicate fields. Each edge filter is written
numbering its params from `$1`; `shiftPlaceholders` renumbers them against the
concatenated params slice before they are joined into one body.

### Generated face — `<Entity>Query.Where<Edge>`

`wrapper_query.go.tmpl` emits one thin method per edge field, delegating to the
substrate — the same pattern `Filter`/`Cascade` already use:

```go
func (q *OwnerQuery) WherePets(filter string, params ...any) *OwnerQuery {
	q.typed.WhereEdge("pets", filter, params...)
	return q
}
```

The method name is `Where` + the field's accessor name; the predicate string is
the field's resolved dgraph predicate. Generated for every edge field (multi,
singular, and reverse). No parser changes — `model.Field` already carries
`IsEdge`/`Predicate`.

## Error handling

`WhereEdge` never executes — it only appends. The request error (malformed
filter, transport failure) surfaces from the terminal: `Nodes`/`First`/
`NodesAndCount` return it; `IterNodes` yields one `(nil, err)` and stops. A var
block matching zero roots is not an error — `uid()` of an empty var yields no
rows, so the terminal returns an empty result.

## Testing

- **`typed/query_test.go`** — `owner`/`pet` test types (an edge pair).
  Behavioral tests against the file engine: `WhereEdge` filters by edge target;
  no match yields empty; `$N` params bind; `WhereEdge` composes with a root
  `Filter`; a `UID` root is preserved (intersection, not overwrite); two
  `WhereEdge` calls AND; `First`, `IterNodes`, and `NodesAndCount` honor edge
  constraints (the count reflects the full match, independent of `Limit`).
- **`typed/query_internal_test.go`** — white-box assertion that the rendered DQL
  is a server-side var (`mgMatched as var(`, `uid(mgMatched)`) carrying no
  inlined `uid(0x…)` literal list.
- **`generator_test.go`** — a two-type edge schema asserts `Where<Edge>` is
  generated and delegates to `typed.WhereEdge`, and that an edgeless type gets
  no `Where*` method.
- **`wrapper_query_e2e_test.go`** — `client.Director.Query(ctx).WhereFilms(...)`
  end-to-end against the file-backed client.

## Migration / blast radius

- **Modified:** `typed/query.go` (struct fields, `WhereEdge`, the
  `runEdge`/`edgeBlocks`/`edgeVarBlock`/`edgeCountBlock`/`edgeMatchBody`/
  `shiftPlaceholders` helpers, edge-aware terminals, doc comments);
  `typed/client.go` (`Query` passes `conn`/`ctx`); `wrapper_query.go.tmpl`
  (generated `Where<Edge>`).
- **Regenerated:** the `movies` fixture — every `*_query_gen.go` for an entity
  with edges gains `Where<Edge>` methods.
- **New tests** in `typed/query_test.go`, `typed/query_internal_test.go`,
  `generator_test.go`, `wrapper_query_e2e_test.go`.
- No change to `Filter`, `Nodes`, `First`, `IterNodes`, CRUD, or any other
  generated artifact. The var-block path is inert unless `WhereEdge` is called.

## Open decisions

None. The string-filter API (over a typed DSL) and one-hop depth were settled
before implementation; the typed predicate DSL is recorded above as future work.
The semi-join runs server-side via a var block rather than the client-side
pre-pass an earlier draft proposed, so matched UIDs stay off the client — see
*Why This Approach*.
